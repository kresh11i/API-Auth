🔐 API Authentication Explorer
This project demonstrates how to interact with secured REST APIs using different types of authentication methods with Node.js, Express, and Axios. It's part of my fullstack learning journey to understand how real-world APIs handle access and security.

🚀 Features
✅ No Auth – Access open endpoints without any credentials.

🔑 Basic Auth – Send encoded username and password via headers.

🔐 API Key Auth – Attach an API key as a query parameter or request header.

🛡️ Bearer Token Auth – Use JWT-style tokens in the Authorization header for secure access.

🧠 What I Learned
How to structure secure API calls using Axios.

Understanding the difference between each auth method.

Handling 401 Unauthorized errors and debugging authentication issues.

Using EJS for dynamic response rendering.
